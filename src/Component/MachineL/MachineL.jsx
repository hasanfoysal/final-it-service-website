      A machine learning engineer is a data scientist who specializes in developing and implementing machine learning algorithms. They work with large datasets to train models that can make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Their tasks include data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Machine learning engineers play a crucial role in various fields, such as finance, healthcare, and marketing. </p></Fade>
